# PRACTICE NEXTJS TUTORIAL 02

## Project description

What is Nextjs and what does it promise us (taken from its official page).

> Nextjs is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

> By framework, we mean Nextjs handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

> You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, integrations - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

> Whether youâ€™re an individual developer or part of a larger team, you can leverage React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly dynamic, and performant web applications.
